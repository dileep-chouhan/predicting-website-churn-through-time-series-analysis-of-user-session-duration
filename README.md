# Predicting Website Churn Through Time Series Analysis of User Session Duration

## Overview

This project utilizes time series analysis to predict website churn based on user session duration data.  By analyzing trends and patterns in session length over time, we aim to identify potential indicators of user disengagement and proactively develop strategies to improve user retention. The analysis involves data preprocessing, time series decomposition, model fitting, and prediction, ultimately providing insights into the relationship between session duration and churn.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Statsmodels (or other relevant time series library if used)


## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Then, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Analysis:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This will perform the time series analysis and generate the output.


## Example Output

The script will print key analysis results to the console, including summary statistics, model parameters (if applicable), and prediction metrics.  Additionally, the analysis will generate one or more visualization files (e.g., `session_duration_trend.png`, `forecasted_churn.png`) depicting the trends in session duration and churn predictions. These plots will be saved in the project directory.  The specific outputs will depend on the chosen time series models and analysis techniques.
